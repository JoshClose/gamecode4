This is the source code that accompanies Game Coding Complete, 4th Edition, written by Michael McShaffry and David "Rez" Graham and published by Charles River Media.

It is a complete game engine on training wheels. Good for learning and seeing how real game engines are architected - but not ready for a real game. Getting to that point is up to you and your programmer buddies.

See the accompanying web site: http://www.mcshaffry.com/GameCode for more information.

If you have any problems - just post them on the forums at the link above. We'll keep track of all the open issues in the "Issues" link here on Google Code.

Enjoy!
